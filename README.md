# CustomVoidLevel
CustomVoidLevel is a plugin that sets a y-level to be the void (under y-level 0) and allows you to do things when a player is at that y-level (add a command to run in console etc). It also adds a /void command so you can easily change the void level in-game!

Note: There can be some latency between the player falling to the y-level and the payload.

## How to setup?

1. Download the .phar file.
2. Drop the plugin file into your serverâ€™s plugins folder.
3. Start the server.
4. Configure the config to your hearts content.
5. Restart the server.
6. Enjoy!

## Commands

`/void <y-level | reset>` - Set the void y-level!

## Permissions

`customvoidlevel.void` - Allows a player to run /void
