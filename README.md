<h1 align="center">CustomVoidLevel</h1>
<p align="center">CustomVoidLevel is a plugin that sets a y-level to be the void (under y-level 0) and allows you to do things when a player is at that y-level (add a command to run in console etc). It also adds a /void command so you can easily change the void level in-game!</p>

Note: There can be some latency between the player falling to the y-level and the payload.
